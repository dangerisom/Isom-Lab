## Submodules within Code

If you want your visitors to jump straight into the code organization, hereâ€™s a quick overview of the main subfolders:

- [1-query_code](./code/1-query_code/)
- [2-post_query_analysis](./code/2-post_query_analysis/)
- [3-post_query_informatics](./code/3-post_query_informatics/)
- [4-colocalization_quantitation](./code/4-colocalization_quantitation/)
- [5-python_wrappers](./code/5-python_wrappers/)

Each folder contains its own `index.md` file describing the scripts and their purpose.
